# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Reviews
In the world of industry, sentiment analysis of product reviews can help companies to understand if customers are liking or not products, allowing them to improve the service and stay competitive in the market.
 This is the classic data science project that requires a lot of steps to be solved: text-preprocessing, word embeddings and application of a machine learning model. 

The first step is the most laborious task, which requires a good understanding of the language you are analysing. This problem can be managed fastly by using Chat-GPT. In addition to this analysis, it can be possible to generate a list of pros and cons from each review, create a list of possible suggestions to improve the product and so on.
